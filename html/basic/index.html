	<p>
		Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some static doâ€™s and donâ€™ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.

	<ol>
		<li><h3> Commenting</h3></li>
		<p>
			Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original author, modifications and authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.
		</p>

		<li><h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3></li>
		<p>The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple code does not always depend on the length of the code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An added advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced.</p>
		<li><h3>PORTABILITY</h3></li>
		<p>Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains values referring to â€˜absolute parametersâ€™ such as file names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them so the application can also be run and maintained in a different environment.</p>
